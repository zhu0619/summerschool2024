    "# Lab 1: Ligand-based Virtual Screening \n",
    "\n",
    "In this first lab, we will delve into the realm of virtual screening. Using datasets of 2D molecules, we will develop predictive models to assess inhibitory activity against a human kinase EGFR(Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) protein. Building on concepts from lectures on molecular representation, scoring, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for Chemistry, we will utilize `PyTorch`,`PyG`, `Scikit-learn`, and other libraries to create both GNN models and classical Random Forest models with molecular fingerprints. The ultimate objective is to screen a small commercial library and select 100 promising molecules for further experimental investigation."

    "The protein encoded by this gene is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is a member of the protein **kinase** superfamily. This protein is a receptor for members of the epidermal growth factor family. EGFR is a cell surface protein that binds to epidermal growth factor, thus inducing receptor dimerization and tyrosine autophosphorylation leading to cell proliferation. \n",
